# Image Compression algorithms

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the following image compression algorithms:

- [x] Huffman Coding
- [x] LZW
- [x] Arithmetic Coding
- [x] JPEG
- [x] JPEG-LS

Lossless compression is a method used to reduce the size of a file while maintaining the same quality as before it was compressed
